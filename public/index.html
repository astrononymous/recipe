        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>In a large pot or wok, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.</li>
	<li>Once the oil is hot, add the onions and stir occasionally, cooking for 30-40 minutes or until caramelized and softened.</li>
	<li>While the onions are cooking, prepare the chicken by slicing or dicing it, and seasoning it with salt to taste.</li>

	<li>Add the sliced carrots and trimmed green beans to the pot and stir well.</li>
	<li>In a small skillet, heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and stir constantly for 1-2 minutes, or until the garlic becomes fragrant and lightly browned.</li>
	<li>Pour the jar of General Tso's sauce into the pot and stir well to coat all the ingredients.</li>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>With the addition of a jar of General Tso's sauce, you may not need to add additional vinegar, sugar, or cornstarch. However, you can always adjust the seasoning to your taste, adding more salt or soy sauce if needed.</li>
	<li>Remember to monitor the cooking time of the vegetables and adjust it accordingly, as they may cook faster or slower depending on their size and type.</li>
	<li>Sautéing the garlic will bring out its natural sweetness and nuttiness, and will help to distribute its flavor more evenly throughout the dish.</li>
	<li>The estimated costs are based on a general range of prices and may vary depending on your location and where you shop.</li>
